The plan is to make a VR escape room experience

Each person makes a few small rooms with puzzles in them, the rooms will connect back together and link into one another later on.

Plan for week by week is to each build some sort of interaction/puzzle piece each week. Then later on we can design and put the pieces together into coherent rooms.

Target User: VR puzzle players
Target hardware: Headset analogous
