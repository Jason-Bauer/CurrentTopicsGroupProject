## About this Milestone 

At this point, you should have base research done on the technologies to use and have your workflow in place. Your focus this week should be on building and developing your program. Next Monday will be Milestone 3, where you will demonstrate your app to the professor. You will need to describe the parts that members contributed. The app will not have to be fully integrated for Milestone 3, but does need to be a working minimally viable product by Milestone 4 for class play test.
